#the curent project, **DX-work-cpp-dependencies-plugin** https://github.com/UnProgramator/DX-work-cpp-dependencies-plugin, need the current programs in order to run:

	for the docker version: docker
	
	for the plugin version you will need:
		graphviz - https://graphviz.org/ - aded to the global PATHs
		cpp-dependencies - [github](https://github.com/tomtom-international/cpp-dependencies)
			- Linux/Unix based: local exexutable, but in the same folder with run.sh or to the PAHTs
			- Windows same as graphviz, added to the PATHs
		for cpp-dependencies (also see [github](https://github.com/tomtom-international/cpp-dependencies)) you will also need boost library
			
		if you want to use install-cpp-dependencies.sh on Linux/Unix-based you will also need (also see dependencies to cpp-dependencies, [github](https://github.com/tomtom-international/cpp-dependencies) ):
			- CMake
			- Make
			- cpp/c++, build-esentials
			- boost library
